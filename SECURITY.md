We will investigate all reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

### Scanning Ethics
This tool is designed for **defensive security** purposes. It allows bucket owners to verify their own configurations.
-   Do not use this tool to scan targets without authorization.
-   The "Passive Scan" mode only uses public APIs and does not bypass any access controls.
